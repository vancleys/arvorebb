Fire on the beach
Face to the sky
The stars dance around like gods in the skies
The gold silhoutte
You take off your clothes
And my heart feels the weight of all I don't know
Memories and mountain tops
Drunk on Sunset Boulevard
With the city of angels singing on
Maybe this is just a dream
And maybe we are still asleep
But I, I will miss you when I'm gone
Flickers of the canyon fire
Its hands raised like a gospel choir
If we live forever, let us live forever tonight
Helicopters against moonlight
Our holy mother of the midnight
And if we live forever, let us live forever tonight
Tomorrow we'll go
Back to our lives
With sand in our skin and sun in our eyes
But I know the truth
I've seen the signs
And I've seen the golden gods in disguise
Memories and mountain tops
Drunk on Sunset Boulevard
With the city of angels singing on
Maybe this is just a dream
And maybe we are still asleep
But I, I will miss you when I'm gone
Flickers of the canyon fire
Its hands raised like a gospel choir
If we live forever, let us live forever tonight
Helicopters against moonlight
Our holy mother of the midnight
And if we live forever, let us live forever tonight
Flickers of the canyon fire
Its hands raised like a gospel choir
If we live forever, let us live forever tonight
Helicopters against moonlight
Our holy mother of the midnight
And if we live forever, let us live forever tonight
Flickers of the canyon fire
Its hands raised like a gospel choir
If we live forever, let us live forever tonight
Helicopters against moonlight
Our holy mother of the midnight
And if we live forever, let us live forever tonight
